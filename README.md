# Evac4Bim
A Revit add-in for better integration of Fire Evacuation into te BIM worklfow. 

This add-in was developed as part of a master thesis and in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of The International Master of Science in Fire Safety Engineering [(IMFSE)](https://imfse.be/). The full text of thesis will be published shortly. 

This repository hosts the source code and assemblies.

## Revit version
This add-in can run on Revit 2022 or later versions

## Features 
- Extract information required to perform assessments of fire evacuation performance or compliance (e.g number of exits for a space, width of stairways on a storey). 
    The user can also edit/include additional information (occupant profiles, number of occupants, room function/usage, etc.).

- Feed the extracted information to evacuation assessment tools such as evacuation simulators (by exporting into an enriched IFC file).

- Capture results from evacuation assessment tools (such as evacuation simulations or prescrpitive reviews)

- Display assessment results to the user within the Revit interface and store in the model.

## Build Instructions 

## Case Studies and Sample Projects 
You can find sample project files on this [repo](https://mega.nz/folder/TPpyjAQC#VJr5T6PZo0-9qF5yHBNvPw). 
It includes Revit models, IFC files, Pathfinder models as well as the Solibri ruleset used for validation. Additionally, video recordings are included.
