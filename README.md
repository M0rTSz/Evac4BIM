# Evac4Bim
A Revit add-in for better integration of Fire Evacuation into te BIM worklfow

# Features 
1.	Extract information required to perform assessments of fire evacuation performance or compliance (e.g number of exits for a space, width of stairways on a storey). 
    The user can also edit/include additional information (occupant profiles, number of occupants, room function/usage, etc.).

2. Feed the extracted information to evacuation assessment tools such as evacuation simulators (by exporting into an enriched IFC file).

3. Capture results from evacuation assessment tools (such as evacuation simulations or prescrpitive reviews)

5. Display assessment results to the user within the Revit interface and store in the model.
